#First let's make the variables where we will put the numbers for our calculation
number_1 = int(input("Type in first number here "))
number_2 = int(input("Type in second number here "))
number_3 = int(input ("Type in third number here "))
#Now we can calculate using them
print("Calculated : ",number_1 - number_3)
print("Calculated : ",number_1 * number_2)
print("Calculated : ",number_1 / number_2)
